**The Freedom to Nix**

FreedpomFlake is designed with convenience in mind, providing sane but slightly opinionated defaults for performance and security while still being configurable to meet the users needs.

## Goals

Freedom isn't just about choice, it's also about freeing your time. FreedpomFlake embraces the Nix philosophy of declarative configuration while focusing on:

- **Convenience**: Aims to provide sane defaults that *just workâ„¢* for most users, no further config needed
- **Performance First**: Makes it easy to get the most out of your system with the least effort possible
- **Hardware Support**: Presets for all kinds of hardware with minimal modification needed
- **Minimal Overhead**: Eliminate unnecessary services and optimize resource usage

## Advanced Features

- **Preservation Module**: Provides some defaults for ephemeral root and home, attempts to read system and home-manager configurations to preserve all necessary directories
- **Performance Tweaks**: Enables various options for program priority and scheduling, optimizes pipewire, even provides the cachyOS kernel (eventually)
- **Multi-Architecture**: Support for both x86_64 and aarch64 (hopefully but not yet) platforms

## Requirements

- NixOS 23.11 or later (unstable branch recommended)
- Flakes enabled in your Nix configuration

## Installation

### 1. Add FreedpomFlake to your flake

flake.nix:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    freedpomFlake = {
      url = "github:freedpom/FreedpomFlake";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };

    home-manager = {
      url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };
}
```

### 2. Import the module

configuration.nix:

```nix
{
  imports = [ inputs.freedpomFlake.nixosModules.freedpomFlake ];
}
```

home.nix (if home manager):

```nix
{
  imports = [ inputs.freedpomFlake.homeModules.freedpomFlake ];
}
```

### 3. BE FREE!!
